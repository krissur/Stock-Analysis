# Stocks Analysis for 2017 and 2018

## Overview
Analyze stock data from years 2017 and 2018. Client requested assistance in finding best stock options for his parents, who originally came to him requesting to invest in a specific stock due to feeling compelled by its ticker name, "DQ". The client wants to determine if this is a good stock option and also what other options would be beneficial to his parents. 

### Purpose of Project
Refactor the original code to run more efficiently and cleaner to work in. 
	
### Data
Data received was in Excel form with two tabs. One sheet housed 2017 data and the other 2018 data. Both held Ticker code, included opening cost, high, low, close, adjusted close and volume amounts.

## Results
The data shows that in 2017 "DQ" had a great return rate of 199.4% However, in 2018 "DQ" dropped to -62.6%. This indicates "DQ" has fallen, and a more diverse set of investments could be safer and more beneficial.


## Summary
Refactoring the code made it simpler move through large data sets with variables that are more versitile and easier to debug. Below is my refactored code.

### Refactoring Pros and Cons
Pro's of Refactoring, codes can become easier to read and understand, easier to update and can run faster. 
However, refactoring has con's also, it can be time consuming, mistakes can be made in editing the original code and you could introduce bugs into the code. 

### Advatages of Refractoring
Refactoring made this code run faster by approximetly 0.8 seconds.
